Hi, I’m James, an emerging software developer with a passion for building practical, thoughtful solutions through code. I didn’t come from a traditional computer science background — instead, I dove into programming out of curiosity and quickly became hooked on the challenge of turning ideas into working systems. What started with basic scripting quickly evolved into building full projects games, web apps, and backend systems. Each project I take on is an opportunity to push my understanding further — whether it’s managing state in a quiz platform, implementing game logic in C, or designing clean APIs in a team environment.
